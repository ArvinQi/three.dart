ThreeD
========

#### Dart 3D Engine ####

This project aims to port the [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) JavaScript 3D engine to [Dart](http://www.dartlang.org/).

Starting at three.js revision 47.0, the aim is to recreate all of the existing three.js [examples](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/master/examples), until parity is reached with this version. Beyond this point, further revisions to three.js will be closely followed and matched in ThreeD.
